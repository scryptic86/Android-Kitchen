# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Right now, I am in the process of figuring out versioning and releases. Security updates will be made to any version that requires it or when
a security issue is known to have a fix.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

   Please create and submit an issue for any vulnerability that you discover; alternatively you could skip creating an issue and just submit the proposed change(s). 
I will try to review them often. Dependabot alerts will be configured to automatically merge fixes but
if you have other suggested courses of action don't hesitate to speak up. :)
