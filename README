This Fork is from dsixda's Android Kitchen original creation. All credit goes to dsixda and contributing Devs for the base of this branch.
  - I intend to make some updates to the original work and hopefully add new functions and compatibility with the latest AndroidOS releases; at least from Nougat(7)
through R(11). Everyone is welcome to contribute. I am a little rusty on coding and have plenty of learning to do but I want to be consistent with practice and effort. 
     -- Please feel free to join in contributing and don't be shy about correcting anything I contribute. 
  -> I encourage collaboration so zap me messages and I will try to respond quickly.
